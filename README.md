# VulnHubBoxes

Just a place to document the Vulnerable Machines I have worked thru in prep for the OSCP. The goals for creating this are to document my steps in working thru these machines. It can be frustrating to root a machine and as a few weeks/months pass, you forget what you did. Or worse yet, the little tips and tricks I would learn on one machine then later down the road. I would want to apply it to another machine, but couldn't remeber excaclty want I did.

Another big goal is to become better at documenting my steps, this is more for the OSCP. Long term goals are to aquire the OSCP and before I start paying for course and material I want to freshen up on my hacking

Starting with easy boxes First and will work our way up in difficulty every 5-10 boxes!
