# VulnHubBoxes

Just a place to document the Vulnerable Machines that I have worked thru. The goals for creating this are to document my steps in working thru these machines. It can be frustrating to root a machine and then you forget what you did weeks or months down the road. Even worse forgetting the little tips and tricks I would learn  along the way. 

Starting with easy boxes First and will work our way up in difficulty every 5-10 boxes!

## Easy Boxes

### Rickdiculously Easy
Awesome box and if you are looking to start its a great box to start with even though it can be tough at times!

### LazyAdmin
This was fun box and there is plenty to get you distracted. Even though this box is rated easy I have meant worse SysAdmins!

### JISCTF
Great box, harder than I orginally thought it was going to be, before I started searching for flags I thought I might have missed something!
